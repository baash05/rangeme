# Coding Task
Create a web page using the Flickr public feed (​https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/​) which allows users to search Flickr and see matching results.

Results should be updated as the user types and should include the following attributes:
* A thumbnail image
* The author
* The date taken
* The tags
* A link through to the full size image

We value beautiful UI/UX as well as modular/testable code.

1) Please use React for the implementation
2) Please use Github to share the code with us
3) Please use AWS or Heroku to host the demo
